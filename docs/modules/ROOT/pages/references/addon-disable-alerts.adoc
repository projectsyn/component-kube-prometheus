= Addon: Disable Alerts

Adding the `disable-alerts` addon (enabled by default) will allow you to disable alert rules based on their name.
Furthermore the addon already disables the following alerts by default:

* KubeHpaMaxedOut
* KubeHpaReplicasMismatch
* CPUThrottlingHigh

Those alerts usually generate a lot of noice and are therefore removed by default.

The addon adds the following configuration option under the `INSTANCE.addon_configs.disable_alerts` key:

== `ignoreNames`

Entries added previously in the hierarchy can be removed again by prefixing them with `~`.
